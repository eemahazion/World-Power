# World-Power

## Introduction: 

In this report, we analyze a dataset of all power plants in the world, obtained from the World Resources Institute and public datasets. Our analysis focuses on the impact of energy generation on various factors such as energy prices and CO2 emissions in the United States (USA) and California (CA). We also investigate the types of power plants in our dataset and their contribution to poor air quality. Furthermore, we looked to find out any correlation between the power plants' geographic distribution to the median income and population of the counties they are located in each state in the USA.



## Data Description:

Our dataset contains information on power plants such as their name, location, type, fuel type, and capacity. We obtained energy generation and CO2 emissions data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) API. We also obtained data on the types of power plants and their contribution to poor air quality from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). We also used Census public API to obtain information on population and income by county in each state in the USA.



## Analysis:

To visualize the locations of power plants across the world, we plotted their latitude and longitude on a map using the Matplotlib library in Python. Figure 1 shows the global distribution of power plants.

To focus on power plants in the USA, we plotted their latitude and longitude on a map using the same library. Figure 2 shows the distribution of power plants across the USA.

Next, we investigated whether the amount of energy generated by fossil fuels in a state impacted the price of energy to consumers and CO2 emissions in that state compared to total energy generated. We hypothesized that more fossil fuel energy generation would lead to cheaper energy and higher CO2 emissions. To test this hypothesis, we obtained data on energy prices and CO2 emissions for counties in each state from the EIA API and plotted them against the percentage of fossil fuel energy generation for each state. Figures 3 and 4 show the scatter plots for energy prices and CO2 emissions, respectively.

We investigated the types of power plants in our dataset and their contribution to poor air quality. Figure 5 shows the number of power plants in a county and their contribution to poor air quality.

Finally, we looked to find any correlation between the number of combustion power plants in a county to the median income and total number of households in the county.  Figure 6 shows the number of combustion power plants in a county vs their median income.

## Limitations and Assumptions:

The data used to conduct the analysis was dependent on availability from online sources and thus is not recent which can limit the accuracy and relevance of the analysis. 

The EPA standards have been used to determine the analysis on Air Quality Index and CO2 emission data used for the study.

External factors such as changes in regulations, policies, economic condition and market on the data are not accounted for in the analysis and need to be factored in for further enhancement. 



## Conclusion: 

* Based on our analysis, we found that there has been a significant increase in the use of renewable sources of energy since 2010 compared to non-renewable sources of energy, which are seeing a gradual decline.

* We found that combusting power plants, which burn fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas, were the largest contributors to poor air quality. This finding highlights the need for increased regulation and investment in renewable energy sources to reduce the negative impact of fossil fuel energy generation on air quality and public health.

* There is a moderate negative correlation between the total energy generated and the average price of energy, while there is a weak positive correlation between the percentage of energy generated from fossil fuel sources when compared to the average price of energy in the county. 
This suggests that combusting power plants, which burn fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas increases the price of energy generated unlike renewable sources of energy. 



## Future scope for the project:

World data on energy production, consumption, and emissions from various countries around the world, analyzing trends and patterns, and exploring potential policy options to promote sustainable energy practices on a global scale.

- Analyzing regional energy consumption patterns: This can help identify areas where energy demand is growing rapidly and explore potential solutions for meeting this demand sustainably.
- Climate change impacts: Analyzing the impact of energy production and consumption on climate change to help identify areas where action is needed to reduce emissions and mitigate the impacts of climate change.
- Renewable energy potential: Analyzing the potential for renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and hydro power, in different regions of the world. This can help identify areas where renewable energy could be scaled up to meet energy demand sustainably.
